Introductory Java Resources
===========================

* [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208)

Personally, this book is how I got into Java. The material is easy to consume with
lots of pictures and supporting content. My favorite part about this book is that
it also serves as a solid introduction into object oriented programming concepts.

* [Udemy Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/)

I haven't taken this course yet, although I have never been let down by udemy
courses in the past. Apparently the course moves quickly which could be a
desirable trait for someone who already has a base in another language.

* [MOOC Object-Oriented Programming with Java](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/)

"During this course you will learn all the basics of computer programming,
algorithms and object-oriented programming using the Java programming language.
The course includes comprehensive course materials and plenty of programming
exercises..."

* [New to Java Programming Center](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/newtojava/overview/index.html)

This is Oracle's page for new Java programmers. Oracle is the company that
currently owns the Java programming language. They host the official reference
documentation. In addition they have a lot of "trails" that teach a specific
area of the language, like how to make GUIs or work with networking tools.
